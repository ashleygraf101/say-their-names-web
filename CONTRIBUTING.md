## Ground Rules

### Git workflow

The main branch is development, where all ongoing development work converges. master branch is reserved for some more finished version of the app.

To get all setup, fork this repo and do all of your work there.

When working on something, create a new branch from development, and make a PR back into the development branch in the main repo.

There are multiple people working from different timezones, so it's good to try to keep your branch up-to-date by rebasing it on top of latest development.

Try to not let your work get stale and out of date. The best approach is to make smaller PRs: for example, laying some foundation for a feature, or refactoring, can be PR'd before continuing further with feature development.

### Making a PR

Before making a PR, ensure all files are linted according to our eslint configuration and tests pass locally(not yet setup, but soon).

When making a PR, add a meaningful title and description. And fill the auto-generated PR template as best as you can.

If any development is done on the UI (additions or non-trivial changes), please include a screenshot of the change.

Tag `Say-Their-Name/web` group as a reviewer, so all web contributors get a notification.

### Bugs or Features?

Create a new issue to report bugs and propose features if a similar issue has not already been opened.

When opening a new issue for a bug, add a title and a clear description with code samples or an executable test case demonstrating the issue.

## The project

### Technologies

- React
- Styled Components
- React Router
- React Testing Library

Almost all of the code you'll touch in this codebase will be JavaScript.

### Third-party dependencies

The intention is to keep the amount of third-party dependencies to a minimum. However, it's better to add a dependency rather than write or copy over untested code. If in doubt, don't hesitate to consult with the community - there is usually a reasonable solution :)

## First Time Setup
